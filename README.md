# Outer Wilds Voice Mod

This mod will eventually add voice acting to all Outer Wilds characters! Hearthians, Nomai, the Prisoner, and even you. THIS IS A VERY EARLY VERSION! Currently, there are only some demo voice lines for Slate (which are in no way final) that show how the mod works. All voice acting will be gathered by the community. If you want to contribute to the project, come join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/daHHqkKChm.

**TO DO:**
* add config menu with:
  + enable/disable splash skip
  + enable/disable character voices
  + enable/disable nomai wall voices
  + enable/disable nomai recording voices
  + enable/disable hearthian recording voices
  + enable/disable specific characters
