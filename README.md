# Outer Wilds Voice Mod

This mod will add voice acting to all Outer Wilds characters! Hearthians, Nomai, the Prisoner, and even you. Currently, there are only some demo voice lines for Slate (which are in no way final) that show how the mod works. All voice acting will be gathered by the community. If you want to contribute to the projeect, come join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/daHHqkKChm.

  + enable/disable splash skip
